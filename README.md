# SvelteKit personal website

My new personal website, powered by [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and [mdsvex](https://mdsvex.com).

### Running development server

```bash
npm install
npm run generate-photos # Run once to generate static images
npm run dev
```

### Building for production

To create a production version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

The production build can be previewed locally with `npm run preview`.
