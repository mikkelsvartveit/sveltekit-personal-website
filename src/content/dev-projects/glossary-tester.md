Glossary Tester is a lightweight, easy-to-use web app meant to make learning glossary easy and fun.

Glossary Tester consists of three parts:

- **Manage**: Start here by adding, editing, sorting or removing words in your word list.
- **Practice**: Before you know your glossary by heart, practice here.
- **Test**: When you feel like you know all your words, test yourself here and get a grade!
